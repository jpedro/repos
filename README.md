## Todos

- [ ] Create the `config` subcommand to store `git config repos.*` settings.

- [ ] Create the `add <url>` subcommand to clone a git repo from an url

- [ ] Create the `install [file]` subcommand to clone git repos from a file
      (default `repos.yaml`).

- [ ] Code the `save` subcommand to commit all changes (obeys the
      `repo.save = always | never | ask` git config).

- [ ] Code the `push` subcommand to send all commits to the upstream (obeys the
      `repo.push = always | never | ask` git config).

- [ ] Code the `pull` subcommand to pull all the latest commits from the
      upstream (obeys the `repo.pull = always | never | ask` git config).

- [ ] Code the `sync` subcommand to commits all changes, pull the latest ones,
      and push local commits to the upstream (obeys the `repo.sync = always |
      never | ask` git config).

- [ ] Code the `repos.enabled` git config to turn off all other `repos.*`
      configs.
